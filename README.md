# Mastering prerequisites relations: From handcrafted features to embeddings for PRELEARN at EVALITA 2020
We present our systems and findings for the prerequisite relation learning task (PRELEARN) at EVALITA 2020. The task aims to classify whether a pair of concepts hold a prerequisite relation or not. We model the problem using handcrafted features and embedding representations for in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Our submissions ranked first place in both scenarios with average F1-score of 0.887 and 0.690 respectively across domains on the test sets.
